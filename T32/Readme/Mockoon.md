## Mock API with Mockoon
To simulate API responses during development, you can use Mockoon, a tool for quickly creating mock APIs. Follow these steps to set up a mock API for T32 GROCERY:

1. **Download and Install Mockoon**:
   - Download Mockoon from [Mockoon's official website](https://mockoon.com/).
   - Install Mockoon on your machine.

2. **Create a New Mock API**:
   - Open Mockoon and click on the "Create a new mock API" button.
   - Define endpoints for your mock API that correspond to your application's backend API endpoints (e.g., `/products`, `/sales`, etc.).
   - For each endpoint, define response data in JSON format that resembles the actual data structure you expect from your backend.

3. **Configure Your Application to Use Mock API**:
   - In your React Native application, update your API service or configuration file (`api.js` or similar) to point to your mock API endpoints during development.
   - Example configuration using Axios:
     ```javascript
     import axios from 'axios';

     const instance = axios.create({
       baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',  // Replace with your Mockoon server URL
       timeout: 10000,
     });

     export const API = {
       getProducts: () => instance.get('/products'),
       createSale: (saleData) => instance.post('/sales', saleData),
       // Add more API methods as needed
     };
     ```

4. **Start Mockoon and Test**:
   - Start your Mockoon server.
   - Run your React Native application and verify that it communicates with the mock API instead of a real backend.

## Usage
1. To start the application, run:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
2. Open the app on an emulator or a physical device:
    ```bash
    npx react-native run-android  # for Android
    npx react-native run-ios      # for iOS
    ```
